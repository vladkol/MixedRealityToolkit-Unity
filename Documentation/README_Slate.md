### HandInteractionPan.cs
This script handles articulated hand input for touching and moving the content on the slate's **ContentQuad**

#### SlateEnabler.cs 
This script is intended to be used with DragEnabler. These two scripts allow the Slate and another object - for instance a Title Bar - to toggle their active status so that the Touch action only affects one at a time. This prevents interacting with the Slate to accidentally trigger the Title Bar behavior and vice versa. The SlateEnabler script is put on the GameObject that is NOT the Slate. Once attached- it toggles interaction with the Slate when the GameObject is being dragged or touched.

#### DragEnabler.cs 
This script is intended to be used with SlateEnabler. These two scripts allow the Slate and another object - for instance a Title Bar - to toggle their active status so that the Touch action only affects one at a time. The DragEnabler script is put on the Slate. Once attached, it toggles interaction with an accompanying object such as a Title Bar while the Slate is being touched.

#### NearInteractionTouchable.cs
This script must be attached to any object that is intended to receive Touch events from implemented the `IMixedRealityTouchHandler`.
